#ðŸ“Š Predicting Customer Churn in the Telecom Sector

This repository contains the files for a graduation project that predicts customer churn in the telecom sector using **Logistic Regression** and **XGBoost** models. 
It includes all steps from data cleaning to final model evaluation.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Customer churn prediction helps telecom companies identify customers likely to leave, so they can take action to retain them and reduce revenue loss.

 ## ðŸ“– Project Roadmap:

### âœ… Step 1: graduation_project3.ipynb

- Import the dataset.

- Check and handle missing values.

- Handle outliers.

- Check logical consistency.

- Prepare target labels and the final feature set.

### âœ… Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Analyze distributions and trends.

- Visualize important variables and churn patterns.

### âœ… Step 3: Final_replaceout2_LR_grad.ipynb

- Perform feature engineering.

- Handle class imbalance.

- Scale the data.

- Tune Logistic Regression hyperparameters.

- Train the Logistic Regression model.

- Evaluate the model using key metrics.

### âœ… Step 4: Final_replaceout2_XGBOOST_grad.ipynb

- Use the cleaned data.

- Train the XGBoost model with hyperparameter tuning.

- Evaluate the XGBoost model.
